## Author: Crystal Li

## Charter

### Vision
In the worldwide quarantine, movies are one of the biggest channels for entertainments. While people will normally run out of potential movie list during this long Covid-19 battle, it is important to recommend more movies for people to sustain this valuable entertainment. This project is aimed to find users’ potentially interested movies based on their provided movies.
   
### Mission
- Users will input their 3 selected movies based on their preferences, taste, or habits. The recommendation system would present 3 movies that matches the users’ taste most.
- The current dataset is https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/

### Success criteria
-1. The project is based on recommender system, which is unsupervised. The app will mainly aim to raise the relativity between the input data and output data. Thus, the app will first recommend the top 3 movies with the highest absolute scores. Then, it will repeat the process for 3 times to figure out the highest mean relativity. Meanwhile, since the dataset is large, it will also focus on coverage of the dataset. 
- 2. The project aims to suggest the movies based on users’ preference and taste. Thus, the app will provide links to access the recommended movie on difference channels, such as Youtube, Hulu, etc. The business metric will be click-through rate and conversion rate.
